# Examples

This folder serves both as examples on how to configure the plugin for different outcomes things, as well as tests.

**Where you want to go is to the [.eslintrc.js](./.eslintrc.js) config file.** There you’ll find a bunch of different ways to configure the plugin, with comments.

Most other files in this directory are test cases and aren’t super interesting to look at. You can open [test/__snapshots__/examples.test.js.snap](../test/__snapshots__/examples.test.js.snap) to see what they look like after running `eslint --fix`.
